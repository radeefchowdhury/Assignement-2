# Assignement-2
Author(s): Radeef Chowdhury
This project is an atm machine simulator, letting the user withdraw, transfer, deposit, or even print balance based off the set values for the account class. It includes various loops, case switches, etc. 
There was no divison of the task as I did everything alone.
There was a challenge problem included which was to use the least amount of bills possible while a user withdraws money.
